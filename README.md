# Contacts Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/The-manpreet-singh/react-contacts.git`
2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd react-contacts`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
4. Start the app - `npm start`

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
